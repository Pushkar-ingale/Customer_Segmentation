# Customer_Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using three different clustering algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN. Customer segmentation is a technique used by businesses to divide customers into groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or purchasing patterns. These groups, or clusters, can then be used to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize business operations.

Introduction
Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor their products or services accordingly. In this project, we employ three popular clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior or other relevant features. The algorithms used are K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.

Installation
To run the code in this project, you'll need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
To use the code:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the main script or Jupyter Notebook file containing the clustering algorithms.
Analyze the results and interpret the clusters.
Clustering Algorithms
K-Means
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into 'K' clusters. It minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.

Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters, also known as a dendrogram, by either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches. It doesn't require the number of clusters 'K' to be specified in advance.

DBSCAN
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm. It groups together points that are closely packed together and marks points as outliers if they lie alone in low-density regions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer data such as purchasing history, demographic information, or any other relevant features for segmentation.

Results
The results of each clustering algorithm will be evaluated based on metrics such as silhouette score, cluster coherence, and visual inspection of the clusters.
